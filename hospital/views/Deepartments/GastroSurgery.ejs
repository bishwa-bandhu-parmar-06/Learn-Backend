            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Gastrointestinal Cancer Surgery</h4>
            <p>We specialize in the surgical treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and biliary tract cancer. Our gastrointestinal surgeons utilize advanced surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive surgery, robotic-assisted surgery, and laparoscopic surgery, to remove tumors, perform lymph node dissection, and achieve optimal oncologic outcomes.</p>

            <h4>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Surgery</h4>
            <p>We offer surgical treatment options for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, who may require surgery due to complications such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, or severe inflammation. Our gastrointestinal surgeons perform procedures such as bowel resection, colectomy, ileostomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) to improve symptoms and quality of life for patients with IBD.</p>

            <h4>Hernia Repair Surgery</h4>
            <p>We provide surgical repair for various types of hernias, including inguinal hernias, umbilical hernias, ventral hernias, and hiatal hernias. Our gastrointestinal surgeons perform both open and minimally invasive hernia repair procedures, such as herniorrhaphy, hernioplasty, and laparoscopic hernia repair, to reduce the risk of complications, such as strangulation or bowel obstruction, and alleviate symptoms.</p>

            <h4>Esophageal and Gastric Surgery</h4>
            <p>We specialize in surgical procedures for disorders of the esophagus and stomach, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, achalasia, esophageal motility disorders, and gastric ulcers. Our gastrointestinal surgeons perform procedures such as fundoplication, Heller myotomy, Nissen fundoplication, and gastric bypass to improve swallowing function, relieve reflux symptoms, and treat underlying conditions.</p>

            <h4>Colorectal Surgery</h4>
            <p>We offer surgical treatment options for conditions affecting the colon and rectum, including diverticulitis, colorectal polyps, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and colorectal cancer. Our gastrointestinal surgeons perform procedures such as colectomy, proctectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, anal fistulotomy, and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) to manage colorectal disorders and improve bowel function.</p>

            <h4>Minimally Invasive Surgery</h4>
            <p>In addition to traditional open surgery, we specialize in minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted surgery, for select gastrointestinal procedures. Minimally invasive approaches offer benefits such as smaller incisions, reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.</p>
