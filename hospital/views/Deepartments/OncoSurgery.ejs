            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Diagnostic Biopsies</h4>
            <p>We perform diagnostic biopsies to accurately diagnose cancerous tumors and determine their type, stage, and extent. Our oncologic surgeons utilize minimally invasive techniques, such as needle biopsy or endoscopic biopsy, to obtain tissue samples for pathological analysis, guiding appropriate treatment planning.</p>

            <h4>Tumor Resection</h4>
            <p>We specialize in the surgical resection of solid tumors and malignancies, including those affecting the breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, head and neck, and musculoskeletal system. Our oncologic surgeons employ advanced surgical techniques, such as robotic-assisted surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and open surgery, to remove tumors while preserving healthy surrounding tissues and vital organs.</p>

            <h4>Lymph Node Dissection</h4>
            <p>We perform lymph node dissection procedures to remove cancerous lymph nodes and assess the spread of cancer in the lymphatic system. Our oncologic surgeons carefully dissect and examine lymph nodes to determine the extent of cancer spread and inform further treatment decisions, such as adjuvant therapy or targeted therapy.</p>

            <h4>Reconstructive Surgery</h4>
            <p>Following tumor resection or ablative surgery, we offer reconstructive surgery to restore form and function to affected areas of the body. Our oncologic surgeons perform reconstructive procedures, such as breast reconstruction, skin grafting, flap reconstruction, and limb salvage surgery, to improve cosmesis, mobility, and quality of life for cancer survivors.</p>

            <h4>Palliative Surgery</h4>
            <p>We provide palliative surgery to relieve symptoms, manage complications, and improve quality of life for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Our oncologic surgeons perform palliative procedures, such as tumor debulking, stent placement, and bypass surgery, to alleviate pain, obstruction, or other symptoms caused by cancer.</p>

            <h4>Minimally Invasive Surgery</h4>
            <p>We offer minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted surgery, for select cancer surgeries. Minimally invasive approaches offer benefits such as smaller incisions, reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times, enabling patients to return to normal activities sooner after surgery.</p>
