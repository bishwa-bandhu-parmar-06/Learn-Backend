            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Chronic Kidney Disease Management</h4>
            <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires ongoing management to slow its progression and prevent complications. Our nephrologists work closely with patients to develop personalized treatment plans tailored to their specific needs. We offer education on lifestyle modifications, medication management, and dialysis options to help patients maintain optimal kidney function and quality of life.</p>

            <h4>Hypertension Management</h4>
            <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common risk factor for kidney disease. Our nephrologists specialize in managing hypertension and its impact on kidney health. Through lifestyle modifications, medication management, and regular monitoring, we help patients achieve and maintain healthy blood pressure levels to protect their kidneys from further damage.</p>

            <h4>Acute Kidney Injury Treatment</h4>
            <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden loss of kidney function that requires prompt medical attention. Our nephrologists are experienced in diagnosing and treating AKI, whether it's caused by dehydration, infection, medication toxicity, or other underlying conditions. We provide supportive care, including fluid management, electrolyte balance, and renal replacement therapy, to help patients recover kidney function and prevent complications.</p>

            <h4>Dialysis Services</h4>
            <p>For patients with end-stage kidney disease, dialysis may be necessary to perform the functions of the kidneys. Our Nephrology Department offers comprehensive dialysis services, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, in a comfortable and convenient setting. Our experienced dialysis team ensures that each patient receives safe, effective treatment and support throughout their dialysis journey.</p>

            <h4>Kidney Transplant Evaluation and Management</h4>
            <p>For eligible patients with end-stage kidney disease, kidney transplantation may offer the best long-term treatment option. Our nephrologists collaborate with transplant surgeons and other specialists to evaluate patients for kidney transplantation and provide comprehensive pre- and post-transplant care. We guide patients through the transplant process, from donor evaluation to transplant surgery and beyond, to maximize transplant success and improve quality of life.</p>
