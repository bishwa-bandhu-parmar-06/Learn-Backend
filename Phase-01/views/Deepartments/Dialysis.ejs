            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Hemodialysis</h4>
            <p>We offer hemodialysis, a life-sustaining treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Our dialysis unit is equipped with advanced hemodialysis machines and monitoring equipment to safely and effectively remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood, maintaining electrolyte balance and managing symptoms of kidney failure.</p>

            <h4>Peritoneal Dialysis</h4>
            <p>We provide peritoneal dialysis (PD), an alternative dialysis modality that allows patients to perform dialysis treatments at home. Our renal care team offers comprehensive training and support to patients and their caregivers on PD catheter care, dialysis technique, infection prevention, and monitoring, empowering them to manage their treatment independently in the comfort of their home environment.</p>

            <h4>Dialysis Access Management</h4>
            <p>We specialize in dialysis access management, including the placement and maintenance of vascular access for hemodialysis. Our interventional nephrologists perform procedures such as arteriovenous (AV) fistula creation, AV graft placement, and catheter insertion, ensuring optimal blood flow for hemodialysis treatments and minimizing complications associated with vascular access.</p>

            <h4>Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)</h4>
            <p>We offer continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or fluid overload. Our specialized CRRT team provides 24/7 bedside monitoring and management of CRRT treatment, optimizing fluid and electrolyte balance, and supporting hemodynamic stability in the intensive care unit (ICU) and critical care settings.</p>

            <h4>Kidney Transplant Evaluation</h4>
            <p>We provide comprehensive evaluation and pre-transplant care for patients undergoing kidney transplant evaluation. Our nephrologists and transplant coordinators assess patient eligibility for kidney transplantation, perform transplant workup and testing, and provide education and support throughout the transplant evaluation process, helping patients navigate the transplant journey with confidence.</p>

            <h4>Renal Nutrition Counseling</h4>
            <p>We offer renal nutrition counseling and dietary education to patients undergoing dialysis or managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our renal dietitians provide personalized nutrition counseling, meal planning, and dietary recommendations to support kidney health, manage fluid and electrolyte balance, and optimize nutritional status for improved outcomes.</p>
