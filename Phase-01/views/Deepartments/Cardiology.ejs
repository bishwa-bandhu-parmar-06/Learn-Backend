            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Preventive Cardiology</h4>
            <p>Our Cardiology Department focuses on preventive measures to reduce the risk of heart disease and promote heart-healthy lifestyles. We provide risk assessments, lifestyle counseling, and personalized treatment plans to address risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, helping patients prevent the development of cardiovascular disease.</p>

            <h4>Diagnostic Testing</h4>
            <p>We offer a variety of diagnostic tests to evaluate heart function, diagnose heart conditions, and assess cardiovascular risk. These tests may include electrocardiography (ECG or EKG), echocardiography, stress testing, Holter monitoring, cardiac CT angiography, and cardiac catheterization, allowing us to accurately diagnose and treat a wide range of heart-related disorders.</p>

            <h4>Interventional Cardiology</h4>
            <p>Our Cardiology Department specializes in interventional procedures to treat coronary artery disease, structural heart disease, and other cardiovascular conditions. We perform cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty and stent placement), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and other minimally invasive procedures to restore blood flow to the heart and improve heart function.</p>

            <h4>Heart Rhythm Management</h4>
            <p>We provide comprehensive care for patients with heart rhythm disorders, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, and heart block. Our cardiologists offer medical management, cardiac electrophysiology studies, pacemaker implantation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and catheter ablation to restore normal heart rhythm and reduce the risk of arrhythmia-related complications.</p>

            <h4>Heart Failure Management</h4>
            <p>For patients with heart failure, our Cardiology Department offers advanced treatment options to manage symptoms, improve heart function, and enhance quality of life. We provide medical therapy, device therapy (such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and left ventricular assist devices), and heart transplant evaluation for eligible patients, tailoring treatment plans to each patient's individual needs and goals.</p>
            
            <h4>Peripheral Vascular Disease Management</h4>
            <p>Our Cardiology Department specializes in managing peripheral vascular disease, including conditions affecting the arteries and veins outside the heart and brain. We offer diagnostic testing, medical management, and minimally invasive procedures to treat peripheral arterial disease (PAD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and peripheral artery aneurysms, helping patients improve circulation and prevent complications.</p>

            <h4>Cardiac Rehabilitation</h4>
            <p>Following a cardiac event or procedure, our Cardiology Department offers comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs to help patients recover, regain strength, and reduce the risk of future heart problems. Our programs include supervised exercise sessions, lifestyle counseling, nutritional guidance, and psychosocial support, empowering patients to make positive lifestyle changes and improve their cardiovascular health.</p>
