            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <h4>Blood Donation</h4>
            <p>We conduct regular blood donation drives and operate a blood donation center where community members can donate blood to help save lives. Blood donation is a critical part of our mission to ensure an adequate and safe blood supply for patients undergoing surgery, receiving cancer treatment, experiencing trauma, and managing chronic medical conditions.</p>

            <h4>Blood Testing and Typing</h4>
            <p>Once blood is donated, it undergoes rigorous testing to ensure its safety and compatibility for transfusion. Our Blood Services Department performs a variety of tests, including blood typing, crossmatching, infectious disease screening, and antibody testing, to identify suitable blood products for patients and minimize the risk of transfusion-related complications.</p>

            <h4>Blood Transfusion</h4>
            <p>We provide blood transfusion services for patients who require blood or blood products to treat various medical conditions, including anemia, bleeding disorders, cancer, surgery, and trauma. Our team of transfusion specialists ensures that patients receive the appropriate blood products, matched for blood type and screened for compatibility, to meet their specific medical needs.</p>

            <h4>Specialized Blood Services</h4>
            <p>In addition to standard blood services, we offer specialized services for patients with unique blood-related needs, such as neonatal transfusions, therapeutic apheresis, plateletpheresis, and hematopoietic stem cell collection. Our Blood Services Department works closely with medical specialists to provide customized blood products and therapies for patients with complex medical conditions.</p>

            <h4>Blood Conservation and Management</h4>
            <p>We promote blood conservation strategies and practices to minimize unnecessary blood transfusions and reduce the risk of transfusion-related complications. Our team collaborates with healthcare providers to implement evidence-based protocols for blood management, including alternative therapies, intraoperative blood salvage, and patient blood management programs.</p>
